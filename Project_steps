Open arduino ide.
Select the esp32 board (if not seen download it from board manager).
Select AI-thinker after connecting esp32-cam-module(OV2640 & beyond), below specs board doesn't support jpeg format for capturing image but only supprted for streaming (for that use RGB565, grayscale and others).
Paste the main arduino.ino code into arduino ide.
Install all base64 libraries from library manager.
If you can't install then copy and paste both base64.h and base64.cpp file as new file in the same project.
Make required changes like wifi name and password.
Add Deployment Id create from google script.
Now compile and uplaod the code to the esp32 cam board.
After uplaoding hard reseting should be done for that follow these steps: 
1)remove the usb cable connection, press both rst and i00 button on esp32-cam base board (below board which is connect to usb), this is done for downloading code into the board. 
2) After pressing rst and i00 button then connect usb connection and then press rst button that is behind the esp32-cam module (it will uplaod the code into esp32-cam module).
